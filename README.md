### Problem statement

In today's fast-paced world, finding skilled professionals for essential household tasks like plumbing, carpentry, and other maintenance work can often be a daunting and time-consuming challenge. Homeowners frequently encounter difficulties in locating reliable and skilled individuals who can efficiently address their specific needs. This issue is further compounded by the lack of a centralized platform that seamlessly connects service seekers with proficient artisans. However, the proposed mobile application aims to revolutionize this process by serving as a comprehensive marketplace. By leveraging the app, users will be able to effortlessly discover and hire experienced professionals for various home improvement tasks. This ultimately simplifies the process and enhances the overall quality of services in the realm of household maintenance.
